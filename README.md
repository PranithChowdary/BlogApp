## Exploring Cloud NoSQL Databases in Content Management Systems


## Introduction
Digital material is arranged and presented in large part by use of content management
systems, or CMS. The goal of this project is to investigate how to create a reliable and
secure content management system (CMS) using cloud-based NoSQL databases,
particularly AWS DocumentDB. Improving data analysis, retrieval, and storage while
upholding security and compliance requirements is the goal. The project's scope,
methods, and team members' individual contributions are described in this document.

## Project Scope and Objectives
Our project's main goal is to use AWS DocumentDB, a NoSQL database service, to
build a CMS. With a focus on data encryption, compliance, and the incorporation of
Natural Language Processing (NLP) for content analysis, the CMS will be built to store
and retrieve blog material. The main goals consist of:
- Putting data encryption techniques into place to create a safe blogging system.
- Making effective use of AWS DocumentDB to handle data retrieval and storage.
- Utilizing NLP to examine the sentiment of the blog data that was retrieved.
- Ensuring compliance to rules and standards for security.
  
## Methodology
### *Database: AWS DocumentDB*
With the scalability and dependability of the cloud, AWS DocumentDB provides the
ability to handle change in data requirements. Our decision to utilize DocumentDB was
influenced by its smooth interaction with other AWS services, convenience of usage,
and compatibility with MongoDB.
Programming Script: Python
Python will be the main programming language used to build NLP features and script
database interactions. Its large libraries and ease of use make it the perfect option for
quick development.

### *Platform: AWS*
Because of AWS's extensive service portfolio, scalability, and dependability, we have chosen it
as our cloud platform. With its smooth integrations with other AWS services, AWS DocumentDB
offers our CMS a complete environment.
